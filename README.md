# TicTacToe
Simple game of Tic Tac Toe using my implementation of the minmax algorithm (http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax).

You can play with another player or versus the AI.

The AI has three difficulty settings:

* **Easy** - It just selects a random valid move.
* **Medium** - It selects the best move on 70% of the cases, randomly selecting a valid move on 30% of the cases.
* **Invincible** - It always selects the best possible move. Either it wins, or it forces a draw.
